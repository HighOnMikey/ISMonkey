ISMonkey
========

Simple extension manager that simply opens a socket and handles the mutation
observers of extensions. Included are a few examples in the extensions folder.

## Installation
These extensions can be either loaded all together here:
[ismonkey.user.js](https://github.com/holychikenz/ISMonkey/raw/main/singles/foodinfo.user.js),
or alternatively through these individual links. For those not afraid to uncomment
a few lines of code, I would recommend taking a selection of the extensions from
the main userscript and commenting out or deleting the lines that load the others.
